# Ideas

## Data
- filter out non-countries

## Map view
- on hover: country name, hdi and raw components values
- add filters: by three indices

## Radar plot
- figure out colorscale
- try out not filling the inside
- display only value on hover
- write HDI value for selected countries to the side

## Line chart
- limit to two countries
- explore colorscale: same hue for a component, different brightness for country?
- display only year, value on hover
- try plotting also HDI with other line style

## Scatter plot
